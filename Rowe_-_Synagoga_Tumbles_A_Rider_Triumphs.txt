Synagoga Tumbles, a Rider Triumphs: Clerical Viewers

Abstract

Ecclesia and Synagoga?flank the ensemble, each installed

Paired female personifications of Church and Synagogue
had become an established subject for medieval art from as
early as the ninth century. But in the thirteenth century the
theme gained particular popularity, given pride of place in
decorative programs adorning the most ambitious cathedral
building projects of northern Europe. While the figures con
tinued to carry established meanings that manifested both the

ecclesiological notion of the harmony between the Old and
New Testaments and the triumph of Christianity over Judaism,

monumental, lifelike instantiations of the theme in the new
context of the cathedral facade invited interpretations in
relation to contemporary secular and sacred ideologies of
power. This article argues that in the eyes of Bamberg 's
clerics, ceremonial movement through the F?rstenportal of
Bamberg Cathedral activated new meanings for the Ecclesia
Synagoga motif, binding the figures to the Bamberg Rider
sculpture within the building. The bishops and chapter of
Bamberg were strong adherents of Emperor Frederick II,
whose policy and ideology hinged in part on notions of the
correct position of Jews in society. Viewed during a ritual en
trance to the cathedral, an aestheticized yet impotent figure
of Synagoga, along with the larger constellation of sculp
tures at the F?rstenportal, could project and reinscribe con
ceptions of Jews as fundamentally base, yet necessary, cogs

This vision of cosmic adjudication and celestial order
was available to all members of Bamberg's urban community
and to visitors to the city, though it appears to have been
created primarily for the rarified audience of the bishop, his

household, the chapter, and guests of the episcopacy.2 In
the thirteenth century the episcopal precinct consisted of the
cathedral itself, the bishop's palace to the northwest, and the

canonical buildings and cloister attached to the cathedral's
south side (Fig. 4).3 It seems that the plaza that stretches
before the cathedral's north side today (bounded to the north

by one arm of the seventeenth-century Neue Residenz, now
the Staatsbibliothek) existed in a similar form in the thirteenth

century. This whole precinct apparently was enwalled, though
presumably still accessible to those who entered its eastern and

western gates. There were occasions when Bamberg's urban
population could have visited the cathedral hill and seen the
F?rstenportal. For example, when the bishop of Bamberg held
his court in the square at the north side of the cathedral, canons,
clerics from local collegiate churches, and, possibly, members
of the city's ministerial and burgher population could gaze at

the F?rstenportal and reflect on themes of justice and retri

as a pictorial means to convey either the theological notion
of the harmony between the Old and New Testaments or the
triumph of Christianity over Judaism. These iconographie
studies are useful because they analyze a range of instances
of the theme of Ecclesia and Synagoga across multiple media
throughout the Middle Ages and amass a body of related
theological texts. But this literature suffers from some of the
shortcomings endemic to iconographie analysis in general.13
Tracking gestures, attributes, and only occasionally the visual
contexts of the figures, questions regarding scale, style, pa
tronage, and particularly viewership tend to be unexplored.14
Studies of Bamberg Cathedral, for their part, typify long
standing trends in the field of medieval art history. Previous
analyses of the building's architecture were largely concerned
with chronology and style, mentioning the sculpture only in
passing.15 Discussions of the sculpture emphasized connois
seurship, distinguishing between multiple hands who worked
at the site.16 Particular attention was paid to differentiating pro
duction of the "older" workshop, responsible for the reliefs at

the interior eastern choir (Georgenchor) and the northeast

In this article, I seek to reconstruct the viewing experience
of the elite group of clerics who were permitted to walk through
the F?rstenportal into the cathedral and proceed to their desig
nated seats at the building's high choir, the western Peterschor.

The clerics of the cathedral and their select guests were
the principal audience for Bamberg's ceremonial entrance, and,

it seems, the only audience permitted to walk through the
F?rstenportal and, as a result, experience its exterior program
in conjunction with the cathedral's interior decor. Only they

would see that the portal program is complemented, indeed

clerics' horizon of expectations as they viewed the F?rsten
portal. These expectations were driven by historical circum
stances and the ideological commitments of the clerics'
overlord, Bishop Ekbert von Andechs-Meran (1203-1237).

An Episcopal Agenda

Bishop Ekbert ruled during much of the time that the cathedral

century their city had been transformed from a cultural back
water and a site of fluctuating political fortunes to a center of
power within the empire. Located in Franconia, in the northern
part of the modern state of Bavaria, Bamberg was established
in 1007 by Emperor Henry II, who founded the city as seat of

building project was under way. He was the magnate under
whom the F?rstenportal was created and the leader whose po
litical alliance to Emperor Frederick II shaped the cathedral's

decorative program.
Ekbert's clerics certainly may have deviated from the
bishop's official positions and likely oversaw much of the
cathedral's construction. Indeed, Bishop Ekbert was away
from Bamberg on the day of the ceremonial consecration of
the cathedral in 1237. He was in Austria, fighting on behalf
of his imperial overlord. Ekbert died within a month of the
cathedral's dedication, never having returned to Bamberg to
see the building project completed. Ekbert's successor, his
uncle, Poppo von Andechs-Meran (provost 1206-1237; bishop
1237-1242), was the first Bamberg bishop to enjoy full use of
the F?rstenportal, and the clerics under Poppo's leadership were

the ones who experienced the site as an integrated image en
vironment. But the early reign of Bishop Poppo is marked
by continuities with rather than breaks from the previous
regime. Poppo had been the provost of the cathedral through
out Ekbert's reign, and when he became bishop he continued
his nephew's political affiliation with the Hohenstaufen.21 The
cathedral clerics, for their part, at times disagreed with Ekbert,
but it was only after the era of Ekbert and Poppo, in the late
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, that the Bamberg chapter

see with luxury manuscripts and liturgical objects, and ordered
the construction of a lavish cathedral.28 Throughout Henry IF s

reign Bamberg hosted multiple secular and ecclesiastical cele

perial court. But following Henry's death in 1024, imperial
interest in Bamberg dwindled. For close to a century and a half

the city strengthened its religious hold over the region and
flourished economically, but in this era, the bishops of Bam
berg had only weak ties to the empire, and the city rarely was
visited by the imperial retinue.

With the episcopal election of Otto II von Andechs
Meran (1177-1196), however, Bamberg's period of insularity
ended. Otto II was one of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa's
closest ecclesiastical allies and was deeply involved in im
perial politics in the 1180s and 1190s. Otto IFs great-nephew

their office they still were immersed in the historical circum

the most powerful noble lines in Germany, Ekbert was able to
cement new connections between Bamberg and power centers
across northern Europe.29 His siblings were among the stron

ends.35 New evidence analyzed by Achim Hubel and Manfred
Schuller suggests that the eastern choir was rebuilt by about

1201, and, following a break in construction about 1210, the
eastern part of the cathedral's north aisle and the F?rstenportal

were complete by 1225.36 Construction of the western portion
of the building was interrupted by another fire about 1227 but

was complete by the time of the consecration in 1237.37
The sculpture adorning Bamberg Cathedral was created
by two teams of sculptors. The first team carved the interior

relief sculptures located on the north and south sides of the
Georgenchor at the cathedral's east end and the sculpture at
the northeastern Gnadenpforte (Fig. 6). They then crafted most
of the jamb figures at the F?rstenportal. Midway through the

apparent that without the assistance of an intimate who knew

the intricacies of the episcopal palace and the precise where
abouts of the king during his stay at Bamberg, Otto von
Wittelsbach could not have carried out his attack. However,
contemporary sources contradict one another over the degree

of Ekbert's involvement. Some suggest that the bishop lured
Philip into the designated spot of the murder or helped Otto
von Wittelsbach escape. Others say only that the bishop's
men took part in the bloody assault, though one source even
doubts Ekbert's participation altogether.31 Recent scholarship
concludes that the bishop did conspire in the murderous plot,
welcoming the assassination of Philip, because the king re
fused to renounce his claims to fiefs included within Bamberg's
holdings.32 Whatever the actual extent of their involvement,

the bishop and Henry of Istria aroused suspicions because
they fled Bamberg for the safety of the Hungarian royal court,

where their sister Gertrud was queen.33 At an imperial diet of

November 1208, when Otto of Brunswick was elected king
of Germany, the princes of the realm ruled that Ekbert should
be tried without an investigation. Shortly thereafter the bishop

was condemned and given the same harsh sentence as the
known murderer, Otto von Wittelsbach. Bishop Ekbert lost

project, a new team of sculptors came to the Bamberg work
site, introducing a sculptural style associated with Reims.38
Scholars disagree over the precise dating of the arrival of this
"younger" workshop. While some have argued that they came
to Bamberg as late as 1235, recent archaeological and historical

evidence suggests they may have arrived in the 1220s.39 The
"younger" workshop carved most of the F?rstenportal tym
panum, some of the right jamb figures, Ecclesia, Synagoga,
and the Bamberg Rider. The team also created the sculptures
that now adorn the southeastern Adamspforte, the freestand
ing works now installed around the Georgenchor inside the
cathedral, and the tomb of Pope Clement II in the west choir.40

Work on the bishop's ceremonial entrance, the F?rsten
portal, was under way during the years that Ekbert sought to
restore respect for himself and his see through adherence to

his imperial overlord. Following Philip of Swabia's murder,
Otto of Brunswick secured the German crown, but had a ten
tative hold on it. Staufen adherents recovered power quickly
and elected Frederick II as their new ruler. Bishop Ekbert
supported Frederick II, attending Frederick IF s coronation
in Aachen in 1215 and becoming one of the first to take up
the cross when Frederick called for a new crusade.41 While
Frederick delayed his campaign to the east until 1228, Bishop
Ekbert fulfilled his vow right away, departing with the first
contingent of the Fifth Crusade in a public display of penitence
and of support for his Staufen overlord.42 Ekbert's time as a

Representing the Ideal

Once the new Bamberg Cathedral was complete, the

ecclesiastical power.53 The order of processions entering this

churches, Saint Stephen, Saint Gangolf, and Saint Jacob, par
ticipated in cathedral rituals.54 These were the ecclesiastical
elites of the city who, along with special guests of the bishop,
had access to the dynamic scopic experience shaped by the
sculptures both outside and inside the F?rstenportal.
When the clerics of Bamberg looked up at the F?rsten
portal, they encountered an ecclesiological visualization of
three eras of human history: the age of the law, the age of
grace, and the end of time foretold in Revelation. Synagoga
represents the age of the old law (Figs. 9 and 10). She is a queen
who once ruled the earth, but now her time has passed. Bearing
a broken staff, she sways and drops her Mosaic tablets. Her
blindfold marks her as misguided and unable to see the truth
of Jesus' status as messiah. Ecclesia, in contrast, stands as
steadfast ruler in the age of grace (Figs. 7 and 8). Her mantle
and crown attest to the legitimacy of her rule while her chalice

return, as Abraham rocks the souls of the saved (for overall

view, see Fig. 3). The constellation of figures on the F?rsten
portal diagrams the key tenets of the Christian notion of his

torical progression.
Visual qualities of the works drew the ensemble out of
the realm of theology into the realms of politics and social
life. When the "younger" workshop came to Bamberg, they
created works in a new, dramatic, and lifelike style.56 Various
factors contributed to the early-thirteenth-century experiments
with naturalism, pioneered by workshops in northern France?

a new emphasis on Christ's humanity following the Fourth
Lateran Council, theological speculation on the status of the
natural world, scientific inquiry into the physiology of vision

and the theory of intromission, among others. Though it is
impossible to know the reasons for the arrival of the "younger"
team to Bamberg, as mentioned above, the archaeological and
historical evidence suggests that Ekbert and his clerics invited
the workshop to their city in the 1220s. It is easy to imagine

that the Bamberg magnates were aware of contemporary ex
periments with naturalism being worked out by sculptors in
northern France and were eager to bring to their cathedral
sculptors working in the most fashionable, innovative styles.
The techniques of the "younger" Bamberg workshop may
have engendered different responses than some of the produc
tions of the "older" team.57 For example, the blocky, hieratic
figures of the Virgin and Child with saints on the Gnadenpforte
seem to inhabit a remote realm when compared to the dramatic
naturalism of Synagoga or the Bamberg Rider (compare Figs.

6, 9, and 14). In the sculptures by the "younger" workshop,
bodies are anatomically coherent, gravity appears to pull on
drapery, facial expression and gesture suggest human emotion.

These stylistic qualities were amplified through coloration.
New research by Walter Hartleitner suggests that the F?rsten
portal tympanum scene was painted in a single pink tone.58 The

Ecclesia and Synagoga figures, however, were vividly poly
chromed. Ecclesia's robe seems to have been ocher-colored,
her crown was gold, and her hair was reddish brown.59 Syna
goga's robe also likely was painted ocher, her blindfold black,
and the clasp on her dress gold. The jamb sculptures may have

been adorned with color, and the pupils of their eyes appear
to have been painted black.60 The Bamberg Rider discussed
more fully below was painted in similar tones.
Just as medieval theologians read scripture on multiple
levels?the literal, the symbolic, the moral, and the anagogic?
so too medieval viewers recognized images on cathedrals to be
polysemous.61 Thus it was possible for medieval monumental
art to be understood by its original audiences as both convey
ing enduring tenets of dogma and inviting interpretation in
relation to more immediate temporal concerns. I believe that
at Bamberg and other early-thirteenth-century centers, dramatic

and lifelike style combined with polychromy enhanced this
phenomenon by visually referring to the corporeal world while

at the same time projecting a transcendent ideal. The sculp

tures of Ecclesia and Synagoga at Bamberg in particular con
tinued to convey their long-standing significances, acting as

a pictorial manifestation of the ecclesiological notion of the

harmony between the Old and New Testaments and the
epochal shift that came with Christ's Incarnation and death.
Made manifest in the forms and colors of the tangible world,
these figures invited clerics to understand sculptural fabrica
tions as embodiments of a divinely sanctioned reality. Recent
scholarship recognizes that mimesis can draw attention to the

artificial nature of images themselves and relies on a cooper
ative audience, invested in reading ideological projections as
truths.62 The same can be said for the new style introduced at

Bamberg as seen through the eyes of cathedral clerics. The
relevant ideological projections at Bamberg orbited around
ideals and realities concerning Jews.

Before the Law

Lauda and Tauberbischofsheim (both in Baden), and at Fulda

As the ecclesiastics of Bamberg proceeded toward the
F?rstenportal, the figures of Ecclesia and Synagoga enframing
a scene of judgment invited reflection on thirteenth-century

imperial concerns about keeping earthly forces in balance.
Medieval rulers were conceived of as vicars of Christ, mini
mizing disorder in the terrestrial realm so that it could as
closely as possible mirror the celestial City of God, in the terms

articulated by Augustine.63 In the twelfth and thirteenth cen

turies there was a new emphasis on the authority of the law

within political theology. In his Policraticus (1159), for
example, John of Salisbury deems the ruler an "Image of Jus

tice," both a quasi-divine being who was above the law and
a keeper of the laws that order society on a celestial model.64

Bishop Ekbert's ally Emperor Frederick II advanced such
formulations, casting himself as law incarnate (lex animata)
and instituting successive new legal codes with the intent to
reform society and keep control over his vast realm, which in
cluded the kingdoms of Germany and Sicily as well as lands

(in Hessen).72 Circumstances seem to have been similar at all
these sites, though we have the most vivid account of the ep

isode at Fulda, where the charred bodies of a miller and his

five sons were discovered in an incinerated mill outside
town.73 In this infamous instance of the blood libel, locals
accused their Jewish neighbors of murder and arson and
launched a riot during which thirty-four Jews were slaugh
tered. One account reports that, under torture, some Jews
admitted to killing the Christian boys in order to draw blood
for ritual use.

The violence of the mid-1230s came to a halt when the
emperor intervened. Following the attacks in Fulda, after both
Jewish and Christian plaintiffs had come before the emperor

at the imperial residence at Hagenau in Alsace, Frederick II
launched an investigation into the accusations against the
Fulda Jews.74 Once he found the charges to be false, the em
peror instituted his Privilege and Judgment in Favor of the
Jews (Privilegium et sententia in favor em ludaeorum) of 1236
to protect Jews against further accusations and assaults.75 The

ruling denounced and outlawed the blood libel and attacks

in northern Italy.65

Within these codes, Frederick's regulation of Jews mani

Jewish violence and Jews themselves in check. In the Assizes

of Messina (1221), Frederick stipulated that Jews bear an
outward marker of their non-Christian status (probably a sky
blue garment or patch), and Jewish men were to grow their
beards.66 The aim of this ruling was to protect Christians
from inadvertent sexual contact with "nonbelievers," as pre
scribed in the canons of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215).67
Later, in the Constitutions of Melfi, also known as the Liber

augustalis (1231), Frederick reviled blasphemers, heretics,
rapists, and murderers, but Jews were not included among

erick I Barbarossa had instituted one charter that proclaimed
imperial authority in all matters pertaining to Jewish life and

customs (1157) and in a second charter (1179) deemed Jews
members of the imperial treasury (adfiscum imperatoris per
tinent), that is, special protectees but implicitly special property
as well.76 Frederick IF s 1236 privilege contained language en
hancing the notion that the Jews of the empire were directly
servile to the emperor and none other, calling Jews servi comer?

evidence of this legal code, other imperial policies, and the

Jews were considered "serfs" or "servants" of the royal
chamber, though those terms themselves are vague. For the
purposes of the present argument, the significance of this
ruling is that, though Jews were not literal servants of any

presence of learned Jews at Frederick IF s court have led some
scholars to categorize the emperor as unusually Jew-friendly,

an enlightened liberal avant la lettre.70 But recent reassess
ment makes plain that Frederick's policies on Jews were pri
marily informed by commercial and practical concerns.71 Chief

among the latter was the drive to keep order across the ex
panse of the imperial realm.
Within the German kingdom, Frederick also proscribed
anti-Jewish violence as a means of instituting peace. Waves

suggests that Jews held the status of slaves. Others argue that

imperial court, conceptually Frederick's 1236 privilege
underscored a notion long prevailing in theology?that in the
Christian world order, Jews were inferior beings to be kept
under Christian watch.79
From the time of the early Church, theologians had con

slaved within the Christian realm.80 Paul explained the story

and thirteenth centuries in the German territories. A series of

calumny and igniting riots, will forever be enchained by Satan.
Once the clerics of Bamberg reached the threshold of the
cathedral, further images cued them to reflect on the position

of Jews within sacred and civil society. To the right of the
F?rstenportal, on the pillar beneath Synagoga, is the figure of

a Devil blinding a Jew, identified by standardized iconog
raphy?beard and pointed hat (Figs. 16 and 17).87 Scholars
have observed that this figure, more directly than Synagoga,

refers to actual living Jewish populations.88 And Bamberg's
population of Jews resided close at hand, concentrated in a
street at the foot of the cathedral hill in the southern portion of

the urban center (Figs. 4 and 18).89 Jews had been in Bamberg
at least since the final years of the eleventh century.90 At this
time Pope Clement III wrote to the Bamberg bishop telling him

to be on the lookout for Jews who had converted to Chris
tianity but were lapsing into their old traditions.91 A Jewish
population in the city is also attested by Benjamin of Tudela's

late-twelfth-century account (1160-1173),92 and the less re
liable Miracula Cunegundis (1199-1200) tells of a Jewish con
version before the relics of Empress Kunigunde.93 In the early
thirteenth century the Jewish street appears to have accom

modated a synagogue, a school, and perhaps a bathhouse and

a dance hall.94 In the same era a local rabbi, Samuel ben

Baruch, was considered an authority on questions of Halacha
and rituals, and he corresponded with rabbis throughout the
German kingdom.95 In accordance with trends across northern
Europe, the Jews of Bamberg seem to have been immersed in

the money trades?pawn-broking and money lending. Docu
ments particularly attest to financial deals between Bam
berg ecclesiastics and local Jews, a circumstance that would
periodically have brought members of the community up the

cathedral hill.96

The bishop of Bamberg was obliged to see that the local
Jewish population did not disrupt the civic order. For, as was
the case across the German kingdom, the bishop of Bamberg
also was the count of the region. It was his right to levy tolls
and taxes on local trade and his charge to keep city life harmo
nious, which he did with the help of an episcopally appointed

mayor (Schulthei?).91 Frederick IPs Privilege and Judgment
in Favor of the Jews claimed authority over the Jews of the

German kingdom, but the emperor seems to have exercised
no imperial prerogative over Bamberg's community. So while
in many Rhineland cities, Jews were made to pay heavy taxes

to the imperial coffers, in Bamberg all such protection pay
ments presumably went to the bishop.98 In exchange for such
taxes, it was the bishop's obligation to defend the community,

keeping anti-Jewish violence to a minimum by closely regu

In this task, Ekbert and his successor Poppo had a blue

fingers the cord of his mantle, a gesture associated with aris
tocratic bearing. The same pose is seen in contemporary depic
tions of regal or noble figures at centers across northern France
and Germany, including the figure of the Bamberg Rider him
self.107 In this context, the gesture only underscores the folly
of the Jew who is seduced by the outward markers of status
but has none of the inner nobility to resist Satan. The bivalent

nature of the Jew came to the fore as the Bamberg clerics
compared the figures on the pillar beneath Synagoga to those

on the pillar beneath Ecclesia. On Ecclesia's pillar sits a now
headless figure, apparently an Old Testament prophet or king,
while above this figure are the symbols of the evangelists rep

resenting the Gospels (Figs. 19 and 20). An Old Testament
figure placed below the evangelist portraits alludes to Judaism's
status as the foundation, the prehistory of the Church. Thus the

figures on Ecclesia's pillar serve as a validation of the faith,
though they also attest to Judaism's obsolesence. An insistence
on Christian dominance over Jewish forebears is further artic

ulated in the F?rstenportal jambs, where apostles find their
footing on the shoulders of prophets. The stalwart Ecclesia
paired with the languid Synagoga, in their turn, present this

same notion in an alternative visual form. Integrated within
the larger ensemble of the F?rstenportal, Ecclesia and Syna
goga invited the clerics of Bamberg to meditate on the position
of Jews in the Christian realm in general and within their city
in particular. The Bamberg bishop lorded over a civic space
in which a Jewish population, both protected and restrained
physically and socially, was integrated within the fabric of the
city. So too up on the cathedral facade, Synagoga, included
but incapacitated physically, was integrated within a fabricated
conception of historical progress.

Triumphal Entry
As the episcopal retinue moved through the F?rsten
portal, the Church's dominance over her forerunner became
all the more visually emphatic. Ecclesia's heavy robe encircles

her body so that waist, torso, and posterior are subsumed in
a swath of fabric (Fig. 21). She is a material manifestation of
coherence and strength. From the F?rstenportal threshold the

clerics could see that Ecclesia's back is a solid block of stone,

//#

a columnlike monolith (Fig. 22). Seen while approaching the
cathedral entrance, the figure of Synagoga, on the other hand,

disintegrated. From the entryway steps, her form became the
very embodiment of lassitude (Fig. 23). Her legs are restrained

by twisted drapery, her head hangs off to the side, and she
teeters, ready to topple from her pedestal like the fallen idols
depicted in contemporary manuscripts.108 And seen from the
top step, glancing up to the right, Synagoga appeared to crash
in on herself (Fig. 24). Hip and splintered staff jut forward.

body; staff and figure alike are broken tools. Her bent arm
and the lower part of her staff further create a dramatic zigzag

visible. Lifelike and dramatic style amplified a long-standing
artistic motif. Through form and posture Ecclesia and Syna
goga became the quintessence of Christian strength and Jewish
decrepitude.
When the members of the cathedral hierarchy entered
Bamberg Cathedral, they found themselves gazing up at the
rear end of a horse and a mounted prince, that is, the back end
of the Bamberg Rider (Figs. 25 and 26).109 The animate clerical

retinue thus became attendants of this stony monarch, who
led the bishop and his men to the interior of the church. Various
feasts at Bamberg called for ritual processions, integrating the
multiple altars that originally were set up throughout the build
ing's nave and aisles.110 The cathedral's two principal altars,
though, were in the east and west choirs. These were designated
for the canons and the bishop respectively, though other dig
nitaries, as well as a group of canons, often joined the bishop

at the west choir.111 So on many feast days, once the epis
copal retinue entered the building through the F?rstenportal,

they walked toward the cathedral's nave, moved beneath

the Bamberg Rider, and then turned west toward the Peter
schor, the episcopal choir (Fig. 28).112
Moving into the cathedral and looking up at the Rider,
the procession of clerics encountered a model Christian prince,

complete with all the features that artists across the empire
and in the French kingdom had codified as markers of ruler
ship (Fig. 27). The Rider's piercing eyes, smooth, beardless
face, chin-length wavy hair, mantle, belt, and the brooch
affixed to his collar recall the countenance and garments of
sculpted kings on the eastern portions of Reims Cathedral and
in the glass at Chartres, for example.113 The figure's grandeur
originally would have been enhanced by polychromy in tones
that complemented those painted on Ecclesia and Synagoga.
The Rider had dark brown hair and black pupils and wore a
yellow robe covered by a reddish orange mantle that seems to
have been heightened with silver-colored foil. His crown, belt,
and stirrups were gold, and his horse was painted white with
gray spots. Gold leaf adorned the harness and bridle as well.114

From the spot beneath this sculpted and painted king,
members of the episcopal procession gazed out on the Rider's
domain (Figs. 27-29). While all churches are conceived as
earthly reflections of the Heavenly Jerusalem, at Bamberg we
have unusually rich evidence of the now-lost polychrome and
ornamentation that manifested this metaphor visually.115 At
the time of its consecration, the walls and vaults of the Bam
berg interior were a deep pink, the ribs and other architectural

details were ivory white, the columns gray, the capitals and
consoles yellow ocher, and in the high altar at the west end,

a diaper pattern adorned the vaults and ribs (traces remain).
Colored glass in the windows and multiple tiny oil lamps hang
ing from the ceiling amplified the painted splendor of the space.
Following typical practice, the cathedral was further adorned

on high feast days. The walls were hung with tapestries, the
space was lit by ornamental lamps, and luxurious reliquaries
were displayed.116
At the margins of this celestial vision, in the vaults of the
nave, are two ghastly faces, painted on the ceiling apparently
in the early thirteenth century (Figs. 30-32).117 They hover in
the nave vaults, in the second bay from the west, one head in
the southern quadrant, the other in the eastern quadrant, each
adjacent to a vault rib. Visible to the clerical retinue both from
the nave and from the western high choir, these heads mocked
the celebrants below. Both wear a pointed cap with a large
brim extending out over his face. One is oriented frontally,
exposing fully his beastlike, half-closed, sleepy eyes and large
nose with prodigious nostrils. From his gaping mouth emerges
a dangling tongue, wagging like that of a dog. Two shaggy

nose whose form echoes those of his hat brim and tongue?
three protruding members refusing to be contained. The pointed

hats, beard, and oversized proboscises accord with stereotyped
images of Jewish men seen in contemporary works created at

centers across northern Europe (for example, Fig. 33).118
Mocking and nefarious Jews were poised at the margins of
the celestial kingdom governed by the Bamberg Rider. They
threatened the divine order, but were kept at bay.

Once the bishop and his clerics settled in the stalls at
the western choir, they could look up at the Jewish figures in
the vaults and contemplate the Bamberg Rider. The Rider casts
his gaze toward the southwestern portion of the cathedral, thus
back toward the high choir, the episcopal retinue, and perhaps
a monumental crucifix once installed there along with a tomb
for Pope Clement II (d. 1047).119 Who is this ruler overseeing
the Bamberg interior? No attributes identify him explicitly as
a historical or a sacred figure.120 Identifications have ranged
from biblical heroes to saints to kings, and today many accept
the argument that he is St. Stephen of Hungary, a celebrated
saint at Bamberg.121 While some interpretive communities in
the thirteenth century and later may have understood the Bam

berg Rider to be a representation of the sainted Hungarian
king and none other, I believe that the Rider was created to
function in more general terms as a type for divinely sanc
tioned rule, rather than to depict a specific individual. As a

type, he accommodated contemporary readings relevant to
the explicitly temporal preoccupations of Bishop Ekbert, his
successor Poppo, and their clerics, particularly the network of
legal realities and ideals surrounding Emperor Frederick II.122
While the figure is not a portrait of the Staufen ruler, I am con
vinced that the Bamberg clerics intended the Rider to refer to

both an eternal ideal and a contemporary reality.123

The common visual features and proximate installation
of the Bamberg Rider with Ecclesia and Synagoga make these

figures a coherent trio, the queenly figures on the F?rsten
portal exterior functioning as pendants to the Rider sculpture
within.124 These three sculptures are of equal scale, carved in
a common style, and originally were similarly polychromed.
As a group they echo other medieval representations of rulers

accompanied by feminized figurations of power. The Magde
burg Rider ensemble, a work contemporary with Bamberg
Cathedral, offers the most suggestive conceptual analogy
(Fig. 34).125 The Magdeburg Rider is a freestanding, monu
mental mounted ruler accompanied by two female figures,
one bearing a shield, the other a spear (apparently originally
with a banner). The group was installed on a pedestal with a
baldachin in the middle of the market square of Magdeburg
in the 1230s. Virginia Roehrig Kaufmann argues that the eques
trian figure refers to either the empire in the abstract or the
person of Frederick II in particular and that the paired female
personifications refer to the Italian and German components
of the empire.126 Formal and stylistic similarities between the

Magdeburg Rider and the Bamberg Rider as well as diplo
matic contacts between Bamberg's Bishop Ekbert and Magde

burg's Archbishop Albrecht von K?ferberg (1205-1232) have
impelled scholars to discuss the two equestrian sculptures in
relation to one another.127 Yet the structural similarities between

the two groups?that is, the association of a mounted ruler with

paired female personifications of abstract concepts?appears
to have gone unnoticed.

FIGURE 34. Magdeburg Rider (photo: SLUB Dresden/Deutsche Fotothek).

A twelfth-century panegyrical text that builds on
centuries-old eschatological traditions strengthens the asso
ciation of Ecclesia and Synagoga with the Bamberg Rider.128
This work, a liturgical drama known as the Play of the Anti
christ (Ludus de Antichristo), features a Staufen emperor who,
as the Last World Emperor, unifies all the kingdoms of the
earth, proceeds to the Holy Land, and fights the Antichrist as
female personifications of the Church, the Synagogue, and a
third figure, pagan religion (Gentilitas), stand by.129 Scholars
long have suggested that this play or others like it may have
influenced the representations of Ecclesia and Synagoga at
Bamberg and other centers.130 But the parallels between the
personae in the play and those adorning the exterior and the
interior at Bamberg also are apparent.
It is particularly suggestive that the monastery housing
the single surviving manuscript exemplar of the complete
drama (now Munich, Staatsbibliothek, MS lat. 19411),131 the
Benedictine abbey at Tegernsee, was a foundation held by the
Andechs-Meran clan, that is, the family of bishops Ekbert
and Poppo.132 Indeed, it is possible that an Andechs-Meran
ancestor, Margarve Berthold III von Istria (d. 1188), who
possessed lands in the diocese of Bamberg and whose brother
was Bishop Otto II of Bamberg, borrowed books from the

Tegernsee library.133 The manuscript containing the Ludus
text is a 139-folio miscellany containing works on grammar,
style, epistolary forms, poetry, and letters, as well as a large

excerpt of Otto of Freising's Gesta Friderici.134 It was com
piled in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, and the

Ludus portion (fols. 2v-7) dates to about 1178-1186. Although
there is no evidence that this manuscript traveled, it is pos
sible that it was lent out. Whatever the case, the cast of char

acters in the Play of the Antichrist suggests that female
personifications of world faiths?Christianity, Judaism, and
paganism?werzfigurae established in the lexicon of Staufen
panegyric. The circumstantial evidence linking the play to the

circle of bishops Ekbert and Poppo bolsters the suggestion
that the clerics of Bamberg conceived of Ecclesia and Syna
goga on the exterior of the F?rstenportal as pendants to the
Rider sculpture within.
The Bamberg Rider, presented with all the attributes of
an ideal ruler, seemed to halt his steed and gaze toward the
clerics as they sat in the cathedral's west choir. If the Bamberg

bishop and his retinue reflected on the current world order
as they looked at the Rider, they could draw on a wealth of

imperial panegyric to direct their meditations. Nicholas of
Bari exemplifies the prevailing rhetoric in an ode to the em
peror whom he hails as a ruler who fulfilled sacred prophe
cies, an earthly echo of Christ:
[T]he exceptional prophet King David, in his authority,

foretold of the greatness of two commanders, namely
the heavenly emperor who commands the winds and the
sea, who spoke and things were made, who ordered and
the universe was created. And ruling the earth there is
the magnificent emperor Frederick, anointed with the

joyous oil before all the kings of the world. First he
[David] prophesied the son [Christ], second [he proph
esied] Christ's successor in the empire [Frederick].135
Throughout Frederick's reign supporters cast him as mediator
between the earthly and the heavenly realms and as motor of
cosmic history, an epoch-making ruler who would usher in the

end of time and thus speed Christ's return to earth to judge
humanity.136 More specific to the theme of entry, by the thir
teenth century it was traditional that when a ruler made a cer

emonial entry into a city (adventus) he would be celebrated as
bringer of a golden age, a leader whose presence transformed
the site into a new Zion.137 Frederick II indeed had succeeded

in entering the real Jerusalem and having himself crowned
king of that city in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in
March 1229. This act echoed the long-standing prophecies
about the Last German Emperor entering the holy city and
inaugurating the end of time, prophecies that had been re
vived in texts such as the Play of the Antichrist.138 Imperial

allies embraced the notion that the emperor's successes in
the East forged an equation between the biblical ruler of
Israel, King David, and the present king of Jerusalem, Fred
erick. These encomia are all the more remarkable because
the emperor was an excommunicate at the time.139 Bishop
Ekbert, having spent months and years with the imperial court,

as well as his successor and the Bamberg clerics, would
have been well acquainted with this network of imperial ide
alizations. The Bamberg Rider may not have been created
to illustrate such notions literally. But his placement directly
inside a portal whose tympanum presents the Last Judgment,
the figure's lifelikeness, and its grandeur invited the Bamberg
clerics who looked at the Rider to consider him in relation to

such tropes.

Style and the Balance of Power
In the 1230s, to attain stability in the realm, Emperor
Frederick II established new controls over the Jews of the

German empire. Authority over Jews manifested in micro
cosm the emperor's authority over the whole of the imperial

domain. These political moves built on theological justifi
cations for the enduring presence of Jews within Christian
society. Jews were considered the Lord's original "chosen,"
keepers of the Old Testament who at the end of time might
convert to Christianity. Safeguarding them was thus part of a

divine plan. Because Jews constituted a necessary population
within the civic machinery, while taxes and municipal sur

veillance ensured their submission, bishops Ekbert and
Poppo, in the first half of the thirteenth century, succeeded in

integrating the local Jews within the social structure of Bam
berg, thereby fulfilling papal prescriptions.

At the F?rstenportal of Bamberg Cathedral, a valiant
king, a triumphant Ecclesia, and a vanquished Synagoga,
against the backdrop of a scene of divine justice, collectively
advanced a fiction of the rectitude of Jewish protection and
repression as metonym for cosmic stability. Synagoga appears
as a comely yet powerless member of the Christian retinue. In
keeping with theological notions of outward beauty as a marker
of inner spiritual merit, she is as well proportioned, serene, and

lovely as her neighbor Ecclesia. She is a constitutive, indeed
necessary, member of the City of God. Her beauty underscores
the notion that she belongs among the panoply of figures pop
ulating a divinely ordered society. Her physiological lassitude,
broken staff, and blindfold, however, brand her as a weakling

whose very repression is sanctioned under the current world
order.

Style and form were the vehicles for this message. The
"younger" workshop sculptors experimented with a new visual
mode, presenting idealized figurations in lifelike and dramatic

guises. Bodies are anatomically coherent; gestures are ex
pressive; gravity seems to weigh down drapery?all this, and
vivid polychrome, too. These visual features invited audiences
to understand the world projected in stone on the cathedral as
one in dialogue with earthly existence. Naturalistic form word
lessly insisted that dogmatic visual projections conveyed real

world truths.

The clerics at Bamberg Cathedral could view the F?rsten
portal complex and find comfort that under the current world
order, cosmic harmony would endure. At the end of time the
righteous will find their reward with Christ, and the sinful will

be enslaved to Satan. In the meantime, a divinely sanctioned
ruler administers the empire justly. Under him, cosmic oppo
sitions are brought into balance. Under him the Church stands
strong, ensuring salvation for her followers. Under him, Jews?
archetypal transgressors yet constitutive members of the Chris
tian universe?are rendered impotent and kept at the margins

of society. Remove Synagoga from this delicately balanced
constellation, and the whole edifice collapses.

10. Many now identify the Bamberg Rider with St. Stephen of Hungary.
If they are right, he is not strictly an "earthly authority." I address this

issue below.

11. This claim pertains to the situation at Bamberg as well as other con
texts across northern Europe dating from the early thirteenth century on.

Examples of the Ecclesia-Synagoga motif on cathedral facades include
the cathedrals at Reims, south facade (ca. 1220-1235) and Chartres,
north porch (destroyed) (ca. 1220); the church of Sainte-Madeleine at

Besan?on (destroyed) (ca. 1220-1230); the cathedrals at Strasbourg,
south facade (ca. 1220-1235) and Magdeburg, north facade (ca. 1250);
the Liebfraukirche at Trier, west facade (ca. 1250); the church of Saint

Seurin at Bordeaux, south facade (ca. 1270); the castle chapel at Marien
burg (Malbork), upper portal (ca. 1270-1280); the cathedrals at Minden,
western narthex (severely damaged) (ca. 1275), Freiburg im Breisgau,
west porch (ca. 1290-1295), Worms, south facade (ca. 1300) and Lincoln

Cathedral, south side (now headless) (ca. 1260-1270); the church of
Saint Peter at Wimpfen im Tal, south facade (ca. 1300); and the cathe
drals at B?ziers, west facade (fourteenth century) and Erfurt, west facade

(ca. 1335).

21. As will be discussed, Ekbert's reign is marked by a strong adherence to
the Hohenstaufen. Poppo apparently continued to support this imperial
family until 1242, when he took the side of Frederick II's enemies in
the emperor's dispute with the pope. As a result of the betrayal, Poppo
was stripped of his title as bishop of Bamberg. Between the reigns of
bishops Ekbert and Poppo there was the brief interregnum of Siegfried
von ?ttingen, which lasted one or two months. On Siegfried and Poppo,

see E. Freiherr von Guttenberg, Das Bistum Bamberg (Berlin, 1937),
170-173. On Poppo, see A. Frenken, "Poppo, Dompropst und Electus

22. That Ekbert's canons may not have always behaved loyally is sug
gested by Ekbert's ruling stating that if the deacon should fail in the
administration of corrective measures against the canons, then the bishop

may step in and exercise his authority using violence. Guttenberg, Das

Bistum Bamberg, 86. On subsequent relations between the chapter
and the bishops of Bamberg, see S. Bachmann, "Die Landst?nde des
Hochstifts Bamberg: ein Beitrag zur territorialen Verfassungsgeschichte,"

23. This restoration was carried out at the request of King Ludwig I of
Bavaria. The king's restorer, Friedrich Karl Rupprecht, kept journals
recording the work, now housed in the Archiv des Erzbistums in Bam
berg. In the early 1930s Alexander Freiherr von Reitzenstein created a
typescript of selections from these notebooks. Reitzenstein's transcrip

temporary French works. See Suckale, "Die Bamberger Domskulpturen,"
esp. 39, 41, 45, 52, 53, 76 note 63 and 77 note 74.

39. Feldmann contends that the "younger" workshop arrived in Bamberg
ca. 1228 (Bamberg und Reims, 98-100); Sauerl?nder seems to suggest
they came in the 1230s ("Reims und Bamberg," 190-192); and Paul
Williamson dates the arrival to ca. 1233-1234 (Gothic Sculpture, 93-94).

the arrival of the "younger" workshop to the 1220s, see Schuller, Das

46. Neum?llers-Klauser argues that the linguistic construction within the
treaty (cited in note 45 above) unquestionably earmarks the funds given
by the emperor as a donation to the Bamberg Cathedral building project

(ibid., 32-33). This contention is repeated or suggested in literature
ranging from monographs to surveys. See W. R. Valentiner, The Bam
berg Rider: Studies of Medieval German Sculpture (Los Angeles, 1956),

56. An important starting point for any analysis of high medieval sculptural

styles is P. C. Claussen, "Zentrum, Peripherie, Transperipherie: ?ber
legungen zum Erfolg des gotischen Figurenportals an den Beispielen
Chartres, Sang?esa, Magdeburg, Bamberg und den Westportalen des

Domes S. Lorenzo in Genua," in Studien zur Geschichte der euro

105; and Williamson, Gothic Sculpture, 91. But recently Klaus van

l?nder, "Intentio vera nostra est manifestare ea, que sunt, sicut sunt:

Eickels has observed that the term opus in the document by no means
necessarily refers to the cathedral's construction. Rather, the formu
lation "ad opus" in the context of the treaty simply signifies "for the
benefit of" Bamberg Cathedral or Ekbert as representative of the insti
tution. Further, he holds that a sum of four thousand silver marks was

not excessive, and indeed it was a fair compensation for damages. K. van

is M. B. Merback, The Thief, the Cross, and the Wheel: Pain and the

57. It must be noted that members of the so-called older workshop also
created sculptures marked by dramatic gesture and drapery, such as the
reliefs at the northwestern end of the eastern Georgenchor choir screen.

58. Walter Hartleitner has analyzed traces of the multiple layers of paint
(all in monochrome) on the F?rstenportal tympanum. It seems that
originally the tympanum was covered with a pink-colored ocher paint
with a lime-casein binder, perhaps on a thin white ground. See W Hart
leitner, "Zur Polychromie der Bamberger Domskulptur," "Sonderheft:
Bamberger Dom," 366-380, at 373-375. Hartleitner generously shared
his findings with me in two meetings, in November 1997 and June 2000.

59. On the polychrome of Ecclesia and Synagoga, see Hartleitner, "Zur

52. In opposition to traditional literature that dubs the cathedral the "Ekbert
Dom" (see note 35 above), scholars now stress the primary role of the

chapter in the completion of the structure. See Hubel and Schuller,
"Der Bamberger Dom als Erinnerungsort"; and idem, "?berlegungen
zur fr?hen Baugeschichte," 313-314; and Frenken, "Poppo, Dompropst
und Electus Bambergensis? 176-178. For a compilation of all the docu
ments on the relation of the chapter to the cathdral, see H. Paschke,
Das Domstift zu Bamberg in seinen Bauwendungen (Studien zur Bam
berger Geschichte und Topographie, XLIV-XLVII) (Bamberg, 1972).
53. What follows is an analysis of the F?rstenportal as experienced during
a ritual entrance to the cathedral. Many ecclesiastical rituals, however,
entailed more than simple entry into the church. For instance, on feast
days, the local ecclesiastical hierarchy made processions throughout the
city of Bamberg, though the cathedral typically remained the departure

point for these peregrinations. See X. Haimerl, Das Prozessionswesen
des Bistums Bamberg im Mittelalter (Munich, 1937; rpt. Hildesheim,
1973). Furthermore, the F?rstenportal was not the only door used
for ceremonial entrances. The northeast entrance (Gnadenpforte), for
example, was used during Easter rituals. See P. W?nsche, "Die Kathe
drale als heilige Stadt: zur liturgischen Topographie des Bamberger
Doms," in Heiliger Raum: Architektur, Kunst und Liturgie im mittel
alterlichen Kathedralen und Stiftskirchen, ed. F. Kohlschein and W?n
sche (M?nster, 1998), 25-58; this article repeats some of the findings
in idem, Kathedralliturgie zwischen Tradition und Wandel: zur mittel
alterlichen Geschichte der Bamberger Domliturgie im Bereich des
Triduum Sacrum (M?nster, 1998).

54. See W?nsche, "Die Kathedrale als heilige Stadt," 27 and note 7.
55. There are no early drawings recording the original arm gestures and
attributes of Ecclesia at Bamberg, but comparison with roughly con
temporaneous monumental sculptures at Reims, Strasbourg, Magdeburg,

Trier, and other centers (see note 11 above) strongly suggests that she
carried a chalice and triumphal banner or spear.

supersedes assessments offered in Suckale, "Die Bamberger Dom
skulpturen," 32; and Schuller, Das F?rstenportal, 115 note 239.
60. Hartleitner, "Zur Polychromie der Bamberger Domskulptur," 373-374.
Hartleitner, though, is careful to point to the possibility that the paint
could have been added up to two decades after the creation of the
sculptures; ibid., 376-377.
61. This is a presumption that drives much recent art historical inquiry on
thirteenth-century monumental art. Exemplary studies are Abou-El-Haj,

"The Urban Setting for Late Medieval Church Building"; and W. W.
Clark, "Reading Reims, I. The Sculptures on the Chapel Buttresses,"

94. The bathhouse is first recorded in documents from 1354 and 1361 but
may have existed earlier. See Schimmelpfennig, Bamberg im Mittelalter,

170, Table XII. In 1355 the Bamberg synagogue was converted to a
church dedicated to the Virgin and possibly rebuilt. Today it is a youth
center. See Paschke, Der Judenhof, 3-4; and R. Krautheimer, Mittelalter

Aschkenas, VII/1 (1997), 55-78.

96. A document from 1216 tells of a Jew from Boppard who bought a plot
of land from the Bamberg church (Aronius, Regesten, 180, No. 404). A

document from 1253 reports that the Bamberg monastery of Saint
Michaelsberg had to sell land to meet the interest charged by a Jew
to whom the foundation had pawned a church vestment (ibid., 254,
No. 594). A document from 1257 again deals with Saint Michaelsberg.
This time the abbey pawned a book with a luxury binding to a Jew (ibid.,

264-265, No. 629). For similar cases, see ibid., 288-289, No. 699,
309, No. 732. Art historians have yet to explore the intimate relation
between ecclesiastical indebtedness to Jews and the profusion of church
building projects in the thirteenth century.

Bamberg im Mittelalter, 40-41 and 83-84.

106. I owe this observation to one of the anonymous reviewers of this article.

107. This gesture is made by figures at Notre-Dame and Saint-Germain
l'Auxerrois in Paris, the west choir at Naumburg, and the cathedral of
Mie?en, among other places. I owe these comparisons to W Sauerl?nder,
"Les statues royales du transept de Reims," RdA, XXVII (1975), 9-30.
On regal and noble gestures in general, see J.-C. Schmitt, La raison des

duced in M. Camille, The Gothic Idol: Ideology and Image-Making in

Medieval Art [Cambridge, 1989], fig. 1).
109. Though some scholars argue that the Bamberg Rider originally was
installed elsewhere in the cathedral, Walter Hartleitner, following ex
tensive technical investigation, maintains that the figure today resides

in its original setting (see references in note 114 below). For a dissent
ing argument maintaining the Rider was moved to the site where it is
today only after the Middle Ages, see Suckale, "Die Bamberger Dom
skulpturen," 62. For a summary of earlier scholarship on this question,

see J. Traeger, "Der verschollene Name: zur Deutungsgeschichte des
Bamberger Reiters," Zeitschrift des deutschen Vereins f?r Kunstwissen

schaft, XLIX-L (1995-1996), 44-76, at 44-47. Further sculptures of
the Virgin, a Sibyl, St. Denis, and an angel now are installed on the
north side of the east choir. Scholars agree that few of these figures are in

the spots for which they originally were designed, and thus they remain

outside the scope of this investigation.

chief sites for celebration of the Mass. See W?nsche, "Die Kathedrale

For an earlier assessment, see Suckale, "Die Bamberger Domskulpturen,"

century restoration of the cathedral (see note 23 above): C. Hans
Schuller, Der Bamberger Dom: seine "Restauration." See also J. Zink,

117. The faces described here are painted directly on the pink paint of the
vaults?that is, there is no trace of dirt between the ground paint layer
and the paint of the faces. Thus, it seems that these faces were painted
on the ceiling at the cathedral's construction in the 1230s. See Haas,
"Die Raumfarbigkeit," 25.

118. See references in note 87 above.
119. Pope Clement II's tomb arguably is a further component of the image
environment centered on the F?rstenportal. But because this coffin's
adornment is unrelated to the Jewish themes explored here, it remains
outside the scope of this investigation. For the latest on this tomb, see
the essays in L. G?ller, ed., Clemens IL: der Papst aus Bamberg, 24.

229.

121. See Hubel, "Reiterfigur," with further references.

122. Some scholars contend that the Bamberg Rider alludes to Frederick II,
casting the emperor as a modern incarnation of Constantine or St.
George. See O. von Simson, "The Bamberg Rider," Review of Religion,

IV/3 (1940), 257-281; and G. Ladner, "Die Anf?nge des Krypto
portr?ts," in Michael Stettier zum 70. Geburtstag: von Angesicht zu
Angesicht; Portr?t Studien, ed. F. Deuchler, M. Flury-Lemberg, and

K. Otavsky (Bern, 1983), 78-97.
123. Similarities between the face of the Rider and contemporary French
representations of kings make plain the unlikelihood that the Bamberg
figure replicates the physiognomic specifics of Frederick's face. For a
related argument on monumental sculptures representing types rather
than individuals, see W. Cahn, "The Tympanum of the Portal of Saint
Anne at Notre Dame de Paris and the Iconography of the Division of
the Powers in the Early Middle Ages," JWCI, XXXII (1969), 55-72. For

Other recent investigations of the Rider complement my own,
though I depart from these scholars' definitive identifications of the
sculpture with specific figures?the former with Henry II, the latter with

the messiah as enemy of the Antichrist (as in Rev. 19:11-16): P. C.
Claussen, "Kompensation und Innovation: zur Denkmalproblematik
im 13. Jahrhundert am Beispiel der Reitermonumente in Magdeburg und

124. Mine is not the first study to consider the Rider in relation to other
sculptures inside and outside the cathedral. See the works cited in notes
114, 119, 120, 122, and 123 above. A recent discussion argues that the
Rider functions as witness, drawing attention to the cathedral's chief
relics, the tombs of SS. Henry and Kunigunde, by gazing at visitors

paying honor to the saints' tombs in the nave. See M. Zerbes, "Rei
terskulptur," in Passau, Bayern?Ungarn: Tausende Jahre, 47-49,
